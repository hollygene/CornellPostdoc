```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)




```


```{r phen,include=TRUE}
# First read in the phenotypic data from Olga (already subsetted from previous analysis with treeWAS)
Phen <- read.table("/Users/hcm59/Box/Github/CornellPostdoc/phenAll.txt",header=TRUE)
# Next read in the genotypic data from AMR finder 
Gen <- read.table("/Users/hcm59/Box/Holly/Analyses/Analyses/Ecoli/ARG_table_20210222_171811.tsv",header=TRUE)
  
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
