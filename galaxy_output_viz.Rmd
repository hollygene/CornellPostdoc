## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r load_data, include=TRUE}
staramr_output <- read.delim(file="/Users/hcm59/Box/Holly/Dog_E_coli_project/staramrGalaxy_output.txt",header=TRUE,sep="\t")

# want to get rid of everything after the first .1 so that I can combine datasets with this same type of identifier 
data_clean_phrase <- c("GCA_012245225.1_PDT000477478.1_genomic.fna", 
                       "GCA_012246585.1_PDT000477476.1_genomic.fna")
out <- stringr::str_extract(data_clean_phrase, "^(.*?.1_)") # including the @
# this leaves me with a trailing underscore (_) - should be easy enough to get rid of 
out.2 <- str_remove_all(out, "[_]")

# make this into a function so can use it with apply across the entire dataframe
A <- function(x) {
  x.1 <- stringr::str_extract(x, "^(.*?.1_)") 
  out.2 <- str_remove_all(x.1, "[_]")
  return(out.2)
}


staramr_output_clean <- data.frame( apply(staramr_output[1],2, A), staramr_output[2:11])





  
  
  
  


```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
