## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r mlplasmids,include=TRUE,echo=FALSE}
fastas <- list.files("/Users/hcm59/Box/Holly/Dog_E_coli_project/Fastqs/Assemblies/all_plus_PA_Ryan_036",full.names = TRUE)
test_file <- fastas[2]
example_prediction <- plasmid_classification(path_input_file = test_file, species = 'Escherichia coli',full_output = TRUE)



```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
